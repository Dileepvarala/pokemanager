Hi Srinivas/Raghunath,


Thanks for the response for the mail and interest in gaming application.


Srinivas.
As discussed earlier on phone, this is a game application which involves in using the motion and effective angle usage as well as rich 3D interface game for both Android and iPhone.


As of now, we are planning to test this game for Android devices. Later will be tested with Apple devices like iPhone, iPod and iPad.


As the first phase, I would like to give a small task so that you can understand what exactly the game does really involve. 


Out of this game, I would like to request for a developing of small task first so that we can know what exactly we are trying to have in the game. 




Task 1:


I would like to take a SNAP/CHOOSE FROM THE CAMERA ROLL when the game launches and convert into a 3D cartoon picture and name it so that we can use that image for the rest of the game. 


The image should be cartooned 3D interactive as part of task 1 and if possible move along the screen with out any performance issues. Web applications are available to do this but in this game we need to convert into cartooned for the image( by calling the web or internally in the game).


Please check the task and let me know the ETA for this task and the application that you would be using. 


ANIL/VAMSHI:
I think Eclipse is a free tool and will be using for developing ANDROID applications. Do let me know if we need any other applications.


Please let me know if you need any more info.


Application environment : ANDROID.
Thanks
Dilip
